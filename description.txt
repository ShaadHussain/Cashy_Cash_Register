The Cash Register Problem

Write a web app in Java, Typescript or Python to simulate a cash register clerk who makes change. Its one function should be to take a purchase price and a payment amount and return the change using all of the US dollar denominations $20 and less, including pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and fifty cent pieces. Assume that there is a limited supply (possibly zero) of each denomination to draw from in your register and that the change will include the minimum amount of each denomination needed. For example, a payment of $1.00 for a purchase of $0.89 will return change of a dime and a penny, or if there are no dimes, then two nickels and a penny. Replenish the available currency stock from the payments and simulate a series of transactions to show multiple scenarios.

Include a UI for accessing your program as a cash register.

Document any assumptions you make that are not in the requirements, and provide unit tests sufficient to show that your program works.
